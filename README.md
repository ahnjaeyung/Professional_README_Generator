## Description  
![Professional README Generator Gif](./Develop/images/Professional_README_Generator.gif)  

This is a command-line application that allows a project creator to quickly generate a professional README by dynamically adding information about their project, so that they can devote more time to working on their project instead of writing their README.  

This application was created using technologies such as:
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* File System
* NPM
* Inquirer.js
* Screencastify

Some of the methods used in creating this application were found from resources such as W3Schools, MDN Web Docs, and Stack Overflow.

## Installation  
Clone repo and npm i  
## Usage  
This application is launched through the command line ("node index.js").  Once launched, the user is prompted for the following information about the application repository:
* Project title
* Project description
* Installation instructions
* Usage information
* Contribution guidelines
* Test instructions
* License
* Credits
* GitHub username
* Email address

Once the user has provided their information, a high-quality, professional README is generated under the file name *projectREADME.md*, and all of the user-inputted information will be added in the relevant sections.  A license badge for the user's chosen license will be included in the badges section as well as a link to read more about the licensing details in the license section.  A link to the user's GitHub page will also be added along with their email address in the questions section.  A table of contents is also created with links that will take the user to the corresponding sections when clicked.
